# ENSE-374-Team-Project
### This is the repository for Team Worfâ€™s Group Project. ShareNote is a web app for writing and sharing notes.

As a team we explored the following stages typical in a software project life cycle:
- Project Initiating & Planning
- Software Design
- Software Construction
- Project Closing & Deliverables
---
## Goal
- The ultimate goal through this exploration was to be able to deliver a Minimum Viable Product, that is in some way useful to our target userbase (ENSE 374 students).
- Please take a look at the relevant folders detailing each step of the project's progress.
- Lastly, refer to the 'MVP' directory in the 'Project Closing & Deliverables' folder above to get started in being able to see what our team was able to produce as our first Minimum Viable Product.
